# Introduction

Welcome!

This book will quickly go over multiple programming language
concepts specific to Rust. We'll start with a simple
`Dog` data structure and gradually turn it into a full rust program
using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a Rust language server named [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/).
